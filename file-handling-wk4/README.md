# File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment (Week 4)

This directory contains the solution for the week 4 assignment on file handling and exception handling in Python.

## Files

- `file-handling-assignment.py`: The main Python script that implements the assignment.
- `original.txt`: An example input file.
- `modified.txt`: The output file generated by the script.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `file-handling-wk4` directory.
2.  Run the script using the command: `python file-handling-assignment.py`
3.  When prompted, enter the name of the file to read (e.g., `original.txt`).
4.  The script will read the content, convert it to uppercase, and save it in `modified.txt`.
5.  If you enter a filename that does not exist, the script will handle the error gracefully.
