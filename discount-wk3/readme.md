# Discount Calculator - Python PowerLearn Project (Week 3)

This project is a simple Python script created for the Week 3 assignment of the Python PowerLearn Project. The script defines a function to calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount, with a specific condition that the discount is only applied if it is 20% or higher.

## Description

The core of this project is the `calculate_discount` function, which takes an item's original price and a discount percentage as input. It checks if the discount percentage is 20% or more. If it is, the function calculates and returns the discounted price. Otherwise, it returns the original price unchanged.

The script also includes a user-interactive section that prompts for the original price and the discount percentage and then displays the final price.

## Features

*   **Conditional Discounting:** Applies a discount only if the percentage is 20% or greater.
*   **User Input:** Interactively prompts the user to enter the price and discount percentage.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to manage non-numeric inputs gracefully.
*   **Formatted Output:** Displays the final price with clear, user-friendly messages.
