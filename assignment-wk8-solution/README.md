# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time, providing insights and visualizations.

This project is part of the `Python-PowerLearnProject` assignments.

## Project Objectives

*   Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
*   Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
*   Compare metrics across countries/regions.
*   Visualize trends with charts.
*   Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook report.

## Files

*   `owid-covid-data.csv`: The raw COVID-19 dataset.
*   `covid_analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data loading, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed.** If not, you can install them via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd "C:\Users\Aorus15\Desktop\Online Courses\PLP\Python-PowerLearnProject\assignment-wk8-solution"
    ```
3.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser.
4.  **Open `covid_analysis.ipynb`** from the Jupyter interface.
5.  **Run all cells** in the notebook to see the data analysis and visualizations. Remember to fill in the "Insights & Reporting" section with your observations.
