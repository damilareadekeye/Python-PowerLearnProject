# Python OOP Assignment

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. The script fulfills two assignments: creating a custom class with inheritance and implementing a polymorphism challenge with different vehicle types.

This script is part of the `Python-PowerLearnProject`.

---

## Features

- **Assignment 1: Custom Class (Book)**
  - A `Book` class with attributes for title, author, and year.
  - A constructor (`__init__`) to initialize book objects.
  - A `FictionBook` subclass that inherits from `Book` and adds a `genre` attribute, demonstrating inheritance.
  - Overridden `get_description` method in the subclass to show polymorphism.

- **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge (Vehicles)**
  - A base `Vehicle` class.
  - `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` subclasses that inherit from `Vehicle`.
  - Each subclass implements its own version of the `move()` method, showcasing polymorphism.

## Program Code

The script is located at `oop-assignment-wk5/oop-assignment.py`.

---

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory and run the script with Python 3.

```bash
python oop-assignment-wk5/oop-assignment.py
```

## Example Output

```
--- Assignment 1: Book Class ---
To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, published in 1960.
